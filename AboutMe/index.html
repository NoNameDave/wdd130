        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3><strong>Christiaan Wolmarans</strong></h3>
        <p> I am 26 years old and am currently working as a junior software engineer.
            I don't really have much experience with coding, 
            which is why I have decided to take this course.</p>
        <p> My hobbies include playing video games, going on hikes and going to the gym.
            I am currently engaged and getting married to the most beautiful and loving soulmate I could have asked for at the end of this year.
